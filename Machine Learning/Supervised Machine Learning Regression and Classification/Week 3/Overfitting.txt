what is overfitting : Fits the training data extremely well error zero in train example
							can t predict well new sample (high variance)
what is generalization (just right): fits training set pretty well and can predict any new sample	
what is underfitting : 	does not fit the training set well (high bias)

if we have too much features  the model maybe overfit and if we have too few features the model maybe 
	underfit

Adressing overfitting :
	1- collect more training examples if you can
	2- dimensionality reduction : feature selection to reduce polynomial function terms and select most
		relative features
	3- regularization :is to pervents features from having large effects
