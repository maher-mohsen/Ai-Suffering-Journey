J(w[]),b=-1/m* *sum from 1 to m (yithlog(F)+(1-yith)log(1-f))

repeat{

	wj=wj-alpha*d/dw*J(w[],b)
	b=b-alpha*d/db*J(w[],b)

	}

repeat{

	wj=wj-alpha*1/m*sum from 1 to m (F-yith)*xith
	b=b-alpha*1/m*sum from 1 to m (F-yith)

	}
Looks like linear regression !! :: Dont forget the Fw[],b(x[])
is diff
Same concepts :
	monitor 
	vectorized
	feature scaling
