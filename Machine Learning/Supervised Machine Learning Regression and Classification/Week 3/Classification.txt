why we dont use linear regression in classification:
	linear regression predict any number but we can make threshold
	to split the graph into 2 categories !!!BUT!!! the more u get 
	the line shifting the more misclassifieing u will face
	
binary classification :
	the output is 0 (negative class) or 1 (postive class)
