- when a possible range of featrue is smalll the expected coff is
	big and when the range is big the expected is small

  features scalling helps to optmize gradient descent 
	
	to feature scaling:
	1- divide intervals over max
	2- Mean normalization (feature - mean/max - min) let the values
		around zero
	3- Z-score normalization:
			calc standard deviation
			calc mean
			feature-mean/standad deviation
			get intervals from Z-score
			max = 3
			min = -3
		other min or max values u should rescaling
